              <img src="img/staticBar.png">
            <p>While guiding yourself through the interactive visualization, one part of the screen is always fragmented on the top. It tells you which state visualization you currently on, gives a drop down menu to access other states in ascending order. 
            </p>

              <img src= "img/smallStateChanger.png">
            <p>Allows user who is aware of the map of the United States and can geographically pick an individual state that stands out to them in a grander scale.

              <ul>
                  <li>Created and organized the data sets needed to fulfill the section C requirements.</li>
                  <li>Created the percent() and switch_hour() functions.</li>
                  <li>Finished 5 different tables of data for the Shiny dashboard.</li>
                  <li>Made the dashboard reactive to the hour format and the selected airport and month.</li>
                  <li>Screenshots of the tables I created can be found in <a href="pages/yang_hao_update_03-02-18.pdf">this PDF.</a></li>

            <h4><strong>Sharable with social Media</strong></h4>
              
            <img src = "img/socialMedia.png">  
            <p>Easy Sharability with platforms: 
                <ul>
                <li> Twitter </li>
                <li> Facebook </li>

                    </ul>
              
            </p> 
                <p>Just having a cool visualization is useless if you dont have someone to share it with. In this visualization, the creators have targeted famous social medias to help spread their visualization to the world. 
                    
                    <p>Some more platforms they could have included:</p>
              
                  <li>Google APIs </li>
                  <li>Github or VC for developer uses</li>
                  <li>Data files for open source uses and implementations</li>
                  <li>Design some reactive features for picking date for more information</li>

                  <li>The microdata are records containing the characteristics of individuals compiled from a representative sample of Census forms.</li>
                  <li>The individual, anonymized records are provided by the Census Bureau so researchers can explore the data beyond the published summary tables.</li>

              <ul>
                  <li>To measure domestic migration, the charts look at the place of birth of residents in each state of time. </li>
                  <li>The focus of this report is movement of people from their U.S. state of birth to their U.S. state of residence, foreign born residents were collapsed into a single immigrant category.</li>
                  <li>Likewise, the category “U.S. Other” was created to include residents of states born in Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and a small number of people who in early Census years were identified as being born in Native American tribal territory.</li>
                  <li>Residents classified as U.S. born but without a specific state were allocated a state of birth proportionately based on the make-up of their state of residence for the given year.</li>
